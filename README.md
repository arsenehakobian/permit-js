2. Get the code with the get code button
3. Add this SDK into your own app using npm i --save @permitio/permit-js / yarn add @permitio/permit-js
4. Import the permit instance with import permit from '@permitio/permit-js'; on your main page (the sooner the better)
5. Login your users at permit (details instructions can be found at https://docs.permit.io/elements)
